# UNSUPERVISED LEARNING TECHNIQUE: CLUSTERING 

**PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE USED:** Python 3.x

**IDE:** Jupyter

**TASKS:**
Dataset: Iris Dataset, Vehicle Dataset.

**Clustering:** 
Unsupervised algorithms make inferences from datasets using only input vectors without referring to known, or labelled, outcomes.

A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities.

**k-Means Clustering** 
  To process the learning data, the K-means algorithm in data mining starts with a first group of randomly selected centroids, which are used as the beginning points for every cluster, and then performs iterative (repetitive) calculations to optimize the positions of the centroids
  It halts creating and optimizing clusters when either:
    The centroids have stabilized â€” there is no change in their values because the clustering has been successful.
    The defined number of iterations has been achieved.

**Hierarchical Clustering:**
It is a method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. 
Strategies for hierarchical clustering generally fall into two types:

Agglomerative: This is a "bottom-up" approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.

Divisive: This is a "top-down" approach: all observations start in one cluster, and splits are performed recursively as one moves down the hierarchy.
This is not supported but.

**Dendrograms**

**CONCLUSION:** Unsupervised machine learning technique applied on the input dataset to generate the underlying patterns and trends is shown above.
