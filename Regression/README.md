# SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUE: Regression

**PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE USED:** Python 3.x

**IDE:** Jupyter

**AIM:** To predict the real-value instead of target class for the input dataset.

**Linear Regression:** It is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression.

**Logistic Regression:** Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable(target) is categorical.

**Gradient Descent:** Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the values of parameters (coefficients) of a function (f) that minimizes a cost function (cost).
It is best used when the parameters cannot be calculated analytically (e.g. using linear algebra) and must be searched for by an optimization algorithm.

**CONCLUSION:** Regression techniques applied on input dataset is shown abbove with their applications.
