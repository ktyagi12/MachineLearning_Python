# NEURAL NETWORKS

**PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE USED:** Python 3.x

**IDE:** Jupyter

**TASKS:**

Dataset Used: Hotel Review Dataset, Two Moons Dataset, Diabetes Dataset

**Neural Networks:**

The idea of ANNs is based on the belief that working of human brain by making the right connections, can be imitated using silicon and wires as living neurons and dendrites.

The human brain is composed of 86 billion nerve cells called neurons. They are connected to other thousand cells by Axons. Stimuli from external environment or inputs from sensory organs are accepted by dendrites. These inputs create electric impulses, which quickly travel through the neural network. A neuron can then send the message to other neuron to handle the issue or does not send it forward.

The Neural Network implementation in sklearn provides the alpha parameter to control overfitting.
Overfitting can also be managed by controlling the model complexity, by reducing the number of layers and by reducing the number of units in each layer. 
Produce a graph of training and test set accuracy for different numbers of units in a neural network with a single hidden layer. 
Use the Diabetes data for this analysis. 
Run the evaluation from 2 to 40 units in steps of 2. 
Use the graphing code from the 14 Neural Networks notebook to plot your results. 

**CONCLUSION:** A neural network of hidden layers is generated shown above with different datasets.
