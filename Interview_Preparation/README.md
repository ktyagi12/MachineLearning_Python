**<h2>MACHINE LEARNING INTERVIEW QUESTIONS</h2>**

<h3>1. What do you understand by Machine Learning ?</h3>

Potential Answer: Machine learning is a tool for turning information into knowledge. 
  
   We are drowning in information and starving for knowledge. Enormous amount of data is being generated on a daily basis. There's no use of this data unless we analyse for the under lying patterns within the data.
  
   Traditionally, software engineering combined human created rules with data to create answers to a problem. Instead, machine learning uses data and answers to discover the rules behind a problem.
  
   To learn the rules governing a phenomenon, machines have to go through a learning process, trying different rules and learning from how well they perform. Hence, why it’s known as Machine Learning.
  
  
<h3>2. What is Supervised and Unsupervised Learning ?</h3>

Potential Answer:  

Supervised Learning: Labelled Data, Regression & classification, Map labelled input to output.

Unsupervised Learning: Unlabeled Data, Association & Clustering, understand pattern and discover output.
