**<h2>MACHINE LEARNING INTERVIEW QUESTIONS</h2>**

<h3>1. What do you understand by Machine Learning ?</h3>

Potential Answer: Machine learning is a tool for turning information into knowledge. 
  
   We are drowning in information and starving for knowledge. Enormous amount of data is being generated on a daily basis. There's no use of this data unless we analyse for the under lying patterns within the data.
  
   Traditionally, software engineering combined human created rules with data to create answers to a problem. Instead, machine learning uses data and answers to discover the rules behind a problem.
  
   To learn the rules governing a phenomenon, machines have to go through a learning process, trying different rules and learning from how well they perform. Hence, why it’s known as Machine Learning.
  
   Machine learns through experiences using statistical methods without being explicitly programmed.

<h3>2. What is Supervised and Unsupervised Learning ?</h3>

Potential Answer:  

Supervised Learning: Labelled Data, Regression & classification, Map labelled input to output.

The algorithm learns on a labeled dataset, providing an answer key that the algorithm can use to evaluate its accuracy on training data. 

It develops a predictive model based on both input and output.

Unsupervised Learning: Unlabeled Data, Association & Clustering, understand pattern and discover output.

It provides unlabeled data that the algorithm tries to make sense of by extracting features and patterns on its own.

It groups and interpret the data based on the input data only.

<h3>3. What do you understand by Precision and Recall?</h3>
Potential Answer:  Let me explain you this with an analogy:

Imagine that, your girlfriend gave you a birthday surprise every year for the last 10 years. One day, your girlfriend asks you: ‘Sweetie, do you remember all the birthday surprises from me?’
To stay on good terms with your girlfriend, you need to recall all the 10 events from your memory. Therefore, recall is the ratio of the number of events you can correctly recall, to the total number of events.
If you can recall all 10 events correctly, then, your recall ratio is 1.0 (100%) and if you can recall 7 events correctly, your recall ratio is 0.7 (70%)
However, you might be wrong in some answers.
Recall/Sensitivity/True Positive Rate(TPR): (TP/TP+FN)

For example, let’s assume that you took 15 guesses out of which 10 were correct and 5 were wrong. This means that you can recall all events but not so precisely
Therefore, precision is the ratio of a number of events you can correctly recall, to the total number of events you can recall (mix of correct and wrong recalls).
From the above example (10 real events, 15 answers: 10 correct, 5 wrong), you get 100% recall but your precision is only 66.67% (10 / 15)
Precision: (TP/TP+FP)
