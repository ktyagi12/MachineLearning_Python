1. Load the dataset
2. Normalise the data
3. Build the classifier.
4. Train the model (Guassian, Multinomial, Bernoulli)
4. Predict the target class for an unknown query.
5. Evaluate the performance of the classifier.

**Naive Bayes:**
Naive Bayes algorithm is the algorithm that learns the probability of an object with certain features belonging to a particular group/class.
The Naive Bayes algorithm is called “naive” because it makes the assumption that the occurrence of a certain feature is independent of the occurrence of other features.

The terminology in the Bayesian method of probability (more commonly used) is as follows:

A is called the proposition and 
B is called the evidence.
P(A) is called the prior probability of proposition and 
P(B)  is called the prior probability of evidence.
P(A|B) is called the posterior. 
P(B|A) is the likelihood.

**CONCLUSION:** Supervised Machine Learning technique Naive Bayes is applied on tht input swimming dataset is shown above.
